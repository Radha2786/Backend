-----------------------------Mongoose----------------------
acts as a layer to interact with server and database as only user can interact through shell but application can not so we need a layer (odm  -- object document mapping) so that our express can interact with database
 
install mongoose and connect it with index file

Model --- mongoose interaction with mongodb is done with the help of model
          it provides methods to work with that collection or database 

it is basically just a class and it represents collection in a database
